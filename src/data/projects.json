    "description": "– Arcus Temporum means “arches of time”. The link between the past and the present, and the role of art in the life of Pannonhalma are crucially important. Unique contemporary architectural projects are linked to this client representing an open and innovative approach. These same values are reflected in Benedek Takács’s design, in which the unity of time, place and space is created in a three-directional coordinate system flexibly changing in every medium, while being able to separate and organise various contents into a visual unity. The design is at once remarkably modern, clear, and playful. The content is translated well into a forward-pointing and exemplary design that innovatively links art, past, present and future. – Statement of the Jury, Hungarian Design Award, 2015. Client: Archabbey of Pannonhalma",
